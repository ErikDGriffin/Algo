get hungry
decide where you want to order from
order by phone instead of online
ask for delivery
go pick up because delivery is taking too longcd 
sit in traffic
pick up pizza
realize they messed up the order but too lazy to go back in
sit in traffic
walk up to house
trip up the steps and watch cold pizza fly out of box like a frisbee
throw a temper tantrum
check cabinet and its empty except for a bag of ramen noodles
make the ramen noodles 
eat unsatisfyingly
